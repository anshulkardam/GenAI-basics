Prompting techniques:

Zero-shot Prompting: The model is given a direct question or task without prior examples.
Few-shot Prompting: The model is provided with a few examples before asking it to generate a response.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: The model is encouraged to break down reasoning step by step before arriving at an answer.
Self-Consistency Prompting: The model generates multiple responses and selects the most consistent or common answer.
Instruction Prompting: The model is explicitly instructed to follow a particular format or guideline.
Direct Answer Prompting: The model is asked to give a concise and direct response without explanation.
Persona-based Prompting: The model is instructed to respond as if it were a particular character or professional.
Role-Playing Prompting: The model assumes a specific role and interacts accordingly.
Contextual Prompting: The prompt includes background information to improve response quality.
Multimodal Prompting: The model is given a combination of text, images, or other modalities to generate a response.
